Javascript Code Style Guide
===========================

Okay, this is not a big deal or anything, but for the sake of code consistency, let's have some guidelines. When adding new code to a file, the new code should stay consistent with what's already there (even if that breaks these following rules).

*	Spaces, not tabs. 4 spaces per indentation.
*	No restriction for line length, but suggested ballpark is 100 characters. 
*	Use under_scores for variable names (including functions). Use hy-phens for CSS class names.
*	Constructor functions (i.e. intended to be used with <code>new</code> operator) are an exception to the underscore rule. They are CamelCase and begin with a Capital letter.
*	Prefer single quotes (i.e. first use single quotes, then double when needed).
